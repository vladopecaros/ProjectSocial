# ProjectSocial
Basically a learning project, copy of bigger social media platforms

*Disclaimer: Pardon my spelling, English is not my primary language.

NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO EDIT THE CODE, ATTACH THE DB FILES INTO SQL AND CHAGE THE CONNECTION STRINGS IN CONFIGURATION FILE OF THE WEB APP, as well as GridView connections at administrative pages!!

So this is a project i've ben working on for some time. This is only for my personal learning and knowladge expanding purpouses.
The idea behind this project is to try to make a social media platform like twitter or instagram but without algorithams for feed.
Functions(So far, more to come):
-Creating User Acciunts with username, email and password.
-Creating posts(Textual).
-Finding other users.
-Following other users.
-Liking other users posts.
-Administrative pages where administrators can recieve complaints by users on other users or posts, review them and take necessary actions like deleting.
-Notification panel

Things I still want to add:
-Comments on posts


What did I use so far:
The whole aplication is made in ASP.Net Using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
Login controls and user memberships are handled by ASP.
User information and Posts are stored in SQL DataBases.
HTML Controls made with JavaScript and Web Site appearance made with CSS.

Fell free to look thru the code and leave your comments and impressions, every suggestion is more than welcome.
